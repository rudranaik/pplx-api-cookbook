✅ Research Complete! 📝 SUMMARY: **Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited (KOEL) operates distinct revenue pools across B2B and B2C segments, with B2B further divided into Power Generation, Industrial Engines, and international B2B sales; B2C includes Water Management Solutions (WMS), Farm Mechanisation (FMS), Distribution/Aftermarket, and international B2C.[2][4]** B2B dominates revenue (e.g., Q4 FY25: INR 1,232 Cr vs. total ops INR 1,753 Cr), with Power Generation at 41% YoY growth (INR 678 Cr in Q2 FY26) and Industrial at 40% YoY, driven by defense/railways.[2][4] B2C grew 42% QoQ in Q4 FY25 with 269% profitability jump post-Sanand stabilization, including exports.[4] International B2B up 39% YoY, B2C 77%.[2] **Unit economics differ**: B2B shows steady margins (e.g., Q4 FY25 segment result INR 115 Cr, 26% QoQ); B2C volatile but improving profitability.[4] Customer bases vary—B2B targets institutional (defense, marine, power/large projects), agriculture, railways; B2C retail/farmers via pumps, equipment, spares.[3][4] Competitive dynamics: Power Gen strengthens leadership; Industrial leverages defense orders; B2C competes in fragmented pumps/tractors.[2] Growth trajectories strong across (B2B 21% QoQ, overall 8% YoY FY25), but B2C restructuring via slump sale to subsidiary LGM enhances focus/efficiency, signaling segment independence.[2] Capital requirements unspecified, but cash flows positive (FY25 net INR 248 Cr).[3] Interdependencies low—products map distinctly (e.g., engines/gensets to Power Gen/Industrial; pumps to WMS).[4] No evident cross-subsidies; B2B stable, B2C turnaround masks prior weakness. **Strategic segments**: B2B core (Power Gen/Industrial/international) for scale/leadership. Tactical: B2C (restructured for efficiency).[2][4] Breakup viable—B2C transfer to LGM proves standalone potential; B2B self-sustaining via diverse pools.[2] (198 words) **Sources**: [1][2][3][4] 🔗 SOURCES: 1. https://au.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KIRLOSKAR-OIL-ENGINES-LIM-9743865/finances-segments/ 2. https://scanx.trade/stock-market-news/earnings/kirloskar-oil-engines-achieves-record-q2-revenue-driven-by-strong-growth-across-segments/25006725 3. https://www.screener.in/company/KIRLOSENG/consolidated/ 4. https://www.kirloskaroilengines.com/documents/541738/ff7763fd-4763-6de9-e693-85a15361bff6 5. https://finbox.com/NSEI:KIRLOSENG/explorer/total_rev/ 6. https://www.kirloskaroilengines.com/investors/annual-reports
